# Helper functions

    Check if the provided agent location is valid.

    Given an agent location, check that it is a valid location in the model at
    which to be introduced via a gate. This function acts as a wrapper for two
    further functions - one for checking the validity of an agent location along
    the left and right edges of the environment and the other for checking the
    validity of an agent location along the top and bottom edges of the
    environment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent_location : array_like
        An array containing two elements, the (x, y) location proposed for the
        agent in proximity to a gate.
    upper : array_like
        An array containing two elements, the (x, y) location acting as one of
        the limits for the agent location.
    lower : array_like
        An array containing two elements, the (x, y) location acting as the
        second of the limits for the agent location.
    side : str
        A string indicating on which side the gate lies. Restricted to one of
        ['top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right'].
