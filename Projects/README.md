# DUST Projects
A master folder for dust-related sub-projects.  [DUST](https://dust.leeds.ac.uk/) ([repo](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/dust/), [gist](https://urban-analytics.github.io/dust/), [onedrive](https://leeds365-my.sharepoint.com/personal/geonsm_leeds_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx)),  Dynamic Urban Simulation Techniques is a research group exploring the uses of Data Assimilation (DA) for Agent-Based Modelling (ABM).


## Models
`model.py` - A minimalist framework for building ABMs suitable for the DA side of this projects.  Based on [mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa).

#### BusSim
Bus route simulation.
- Minh Kieu, email: m.l.kieu

#### StationSim
Pedestrian movement in a crowded corridor.  
[Originally developed](https://github.com/nickmalleson/keanu-post-hackathon/tree/stationSim/keanu-examples/stationSim/src/main/java/StationSim) in Java and Keanu, this is a python edition.

#### Screensaver
A minimalist implementation of the model framework.  For use as a testing tool.
