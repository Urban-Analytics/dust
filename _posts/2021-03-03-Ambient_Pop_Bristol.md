<!-- # Ambient populations: Developing robust estimates-->

My colleague [Annabel](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/pgr/2493/annabel-whipp) and I recently gave a talk as part of the [Engineering Mathematics Seminar Series](https://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~nb14397/seminars.html) at the [Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/engineering-mathematics/). It was called **[Ambient populations: Developing robust estimates]({{site.baseurl}}/p/2021-03-03-Ambient_Pop_Bristol.pdf)** and presented our work on estimating the ambient population for uses in crime analysis as well as our ideas for new methods to integrate various datasets to create a more accurate measure of the ambient population. The slides are available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/p/2021-03-03-Ambient_Pop_Bristol.pdf) and the abstract is:

<blockquote>There is typically an abundance of information about where people live (the ‘residential’ population), but much less information regarding the non-residential, or ‘ambient’ population. The ability to produce estimates of the ambient population is integral to the management and planning of urban areas and is a precursor to the development of insights into socioeconomic and environmental issues that impact cities. In this presentation we provide examples that illustrate why a robust quantification of the ambient population is essential to properly understand many social phenomena, drawing particularly on the analysis of crime patterns. We also review a number of new data sources that have emerged in recent years that might help to shed light on the ambient population and propose a means of incorporating disparate data to estimate the ambient population using geographically-weighted regression.</blockquote>
