There are a number of cities across the globe that have installed systems to monitor the number of pedestrians (/and or cyclists) who pass by various locations in the city over time.

The table below provides details on some of those schemes for which we were able to find information:

The location of the sensors in the cities for which data can be accessed can be viewed at: [Locations_with_sensors.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/masher92/footfall/blob/master/Locations_with_sensors.ipynb?flush_cache=True)
